Low Level Design:

SOLID Principal: 

<b>S => Single Responsibility Principle</b>

Weather we talking about Class, Component, Function, Module, Package,
it should have one and only one reason to change.

<b>O => Open/Closed principle</b>

Software enties should open for extension but closed for modification.

<b>I => Interface Segregation Principle:</b>

Dependecny of one class to anather class should depend on the smallest possible interface.
